# Twofold RSC

Twofold is an RSC framework made for creating demos and toy apps to show
off the exciting APIs coming to React 19 and server components.

There's no docs yet, but to create a demo app run the following command and follow the instructions on screen.

```text
pnpm create twofold-app@latest
```

Note that Twofold requires Node.js `20.9.0` or higher.
